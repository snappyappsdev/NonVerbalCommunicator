# NonVerbalCommunicator
App Overview Feature
The Non Verbal Communicator app is used as a way for non verbal children to communicate through the picture exchange communication(Pec) method.  Parents, teachers, or therapist assemble Pec objects in the app. Once Pecâ€™s are added to the app they are displayed in a grid. A non verbal child can then select an image that they are trying to communicate to a person. Once the image is selected the sound that is attached to the Pec is played.
